## Merging words within an app

### This component allows an individual to select which elements from two redundant word entries. They can choose option 1, option 2 or merge the data from both elements. The data would then be updated in the database, however for this demo the newly formed word entry is displayed in a rudimentary fashion via an alert.

## User Stories
## --------------------------------------

### 1. As a user, I want to be able to add to this project because it is part of my history and I want that history to be preserved.
### 2. As a user, I want to have the ability to merge my information into the database because I have included information that is not currently present in the database.
### 3. As a user, I want to be able to easily verify that the information in the database is accurate because if it is not I have the ability fix it.

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
