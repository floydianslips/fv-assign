## Merging words within an app

## User Stories
## --------------------------------------

### 1. As a user, I want to be able to add to this project because it is part of my history and I want that to be preserved.
### 2. As a user, I want to have the ability to merge my information into the database because I have included information that is not currently present.
### 3. As a user, I want to be able to easily verify that the information in the database is accurate because if it is not I can fix it.

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
